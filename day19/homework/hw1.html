    <p>Crude ideas and designs of automobiles can be traced back to ancient and medieval times.[1][2] In 1649, Hans Hautsch of Nuremberg built a clockwork-driven carriage.[1][3] In 1672, a small-scale steam-powered vehicle was created by Ferdinand Verbiest;[4] the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769.[5][6] Inventors began to branch out at the start of the 19th century, creating the de Rivaz engine, one of the first internal combustion engines,[7] and an early electric motor.[8] Samuel Brown later tested the first industrially applied internal combustion engine in 1826. Only two of these were made.[9]
    
        Development was hindered in the mid-19th century by a backlash against large vehicles, yet progress continued on some internal combustion engines. The engine evolved as engineers created two- and four-cycle combustion engines and began using gasoline. The first modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—and the first car in series production appeared in 1886, when Carl Benz developed a gasoline-powered automobile and made several identical copies.[10][11] In 1890, Gottlieb Daimler, inventor of the high-speed liquid petroleum-fueled engine, and Wilhelm Maybach formed Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft. In 1926, the company merged with Benz & Cie. (founded by Carl Benz in 1883) to form Daimler-Benz, known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand.</p>
